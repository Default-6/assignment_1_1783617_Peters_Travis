        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 4th year student in computer science with a passion for machine 
            learning, data science, cars, and my furball Moo.</p>

        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>During school I was given the opportunity to work on a machine learning 
            project analyzing canadian covid and influenza data. The program utilized 
            a package called STPredict that utilizies algorithems such as KNN and 
            Neurel networks. By the end of the project the program was able to predict 
            covid and influenza cases by provice accross canada with only a 5-15% error 
            and is currently in the process of becoming my first publication. I have also 
            taken on projects utilizing computer vision and machine learning to make a program
            capable of playing pokemon crystal to search for shiny pokemon and record the time, 
            amount of encounters, identify and count number of each none shiny pokemon, and the 
            number of shinies found.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I have many interests that reach outside the bounds of computer science, my biggest 
            being cars. I have been working on cars since I was 16 and have had the opportunity 
            to build and compete in a few local drift events. Before school started i activaly 
            imported, restored, and raced several cars including an 1994 Nissan 180sx X-Tail, a 1999 Nissan S15 and
            a 1998 subaru WRX STI V-Limited, however the only one remaining in the garage today is the
            STI. The S15 was my garage princess, it only saw the drag strip once and two auto cross
            events, and otherwise was mainly used as a sunday driver. The 180sx was my drift car, it 
            was rough around the edges and eventually met its end against a wall at a local drift event. 
            Finally the STI that exists today use to be my daily but has been parked since the start of 
            my degree until I have a stable income to support its needs. For now I daily a 2008 Honda 
            CRV, significantly less exciting but it gets the job done without breaking the bank.
